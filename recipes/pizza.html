</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 cup cold water</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>3 cups bread flour</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over
    the top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in
    flour, 1 cup at a time until incorporated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes. Divide in
    half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and
    refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a
    big enough container to allow dough to rise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.
  </li>
  <li>
    Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F
    (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
  </li>
</ol>
