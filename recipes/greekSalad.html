<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  You can't go wrong with this Greek salad, especially if you remember the only
  and most important tip: toss it with the vinegar first before adding olive
  oil. If you don't, it will not taste as good. Which reminds me, giving the
  amounts here is very difficult, since this really should be made to your
  tastes, so please use the ingredient list as a very rough outline.
</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 large English cucumbers</li>

  <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>

  <li>2 cups cherry tomatoes</li>

  <li>¼ red onion</li>

  <li>½ red bell pepper</li>

  <li>½ cup pitted Kalamata olives</li>

  <li>½ cup pitted green olives</li>

  <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh oregano</li>

  <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>

  <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>

  <li>¼ cup red wine vinegar, or to taste</li>

  <li>⅓ cup olive oil, or to taste</li>

  <li>1 (4 ounce) package feta cheese, diced, divided</li>

  <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano, or to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Peel off a few strips of cucumber skin using a channel knife, creating a
    striped pattern. Cut cucumbers in half crosswise. Cut each half into
    quarters before cutting into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices. Place into a colander;
    toss with some kosher salt and let sit for 10 to 15 minutes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Meanwhile, cut cherry tomatoes in half. Rinse cucumbers; drain thoroughly
    for 10 to 15 minutes more.
  </li>
  <li>
    While cucumbers are draining, slice onion thinly. Cut bell pepper into
    strips. Turn knife diagonally and cut strips into diamond-shaped pieces.
    Slice Kalamata and green olives.
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, onion, bell pepper, olives, and 2 tablespoons
    oregano in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Sprinkle in
    vinegar and toss thoroughly. Drizzle in olive oil. Add about 2/3 of the feta
    cheese and toss again. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 to 60
    minutes.
